### Week 01
First we created Trackgenix app interfaces and prototypes with Figma, with its different roles and functionalities.
Then we created the HTML structure of this landing page.
Using Git and Github we create a repository and control the different versions of our HTML document each time that we make changes on it.

### Week 02
During this week we included the styles corresponding to the HTML structure to ensure that when viewing the page, 
it looks identical to the landing of the screenflow made with Figma.
Using Git and Github we save all the changes we make on the documents.
