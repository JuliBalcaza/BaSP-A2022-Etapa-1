### Week 00
First we created Trackgenix app interfaces and prototypes with Figma, with its different roles and functionalities.

### Week 01
This week we created the HTML structure of the landing page that we made on Figma.
Using Git and Github we create a repository and control the different versions of our HTML document each time that we make changes on it.

### Week 02
During this week we included the styles corresponding to the HTML structure to ensure that, when viewing the page, 
it looks identical to the landing made with Figma.
Using Git and Github we save all the changes we make on the documents.

### Week 03
This week we applied Flexbox Layout model to the HTML structure, taking into account different breakpoints to display it correctly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
Using Github pages with the corresponding path we are able to visualize the HTML on browsers.
Using Git and Github we save all the changes we make on the documents.
